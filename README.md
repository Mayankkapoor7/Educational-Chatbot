# Educational-Chatbot
Developed an academic chatbot using LangChain and Groqâ€™s LLaMA 3 model with PDF-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer domain-specific questions, primarily in statistics and machine learning.

Integrated local document retrieval using FAISS vector store and Hugging Face embeddings, enabling prioritization of uploaded PDF knowledge over web sources like Wikipedia, arXiv, and DuckDuckGo.

Implemented a zero-shot reasoning agent with StreamlitCallbackHandler to show live chain-of-thought and enhance interpretability in real-time conversations.

Designed a clean and interactive UI using Streamlit, facilitating smooth file upload, multi-turn question handling, and dynamic memory management for better context preservation.
